# Prerequisites for Functional Programming Workshop
Salutations, fine individuals!
My name is Benson Chu, and I will be giving a series of workshops on functional programming sometime in October, and I will be programming in a few languages that are decendants of Lisp!
To save me the time of having to set everyone up at the time of the workshop, I have made this tutorial in order to help you get set up ahead of time!
