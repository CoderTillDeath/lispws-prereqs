# Prerequisites for Functional Programming Workshop
Salutations, fine individuals!
My name is Benson Chu, and I will be giving a series of workshops on functional programming sometime in October, and I will be programming in a few languages that are decendants of Lisp.
To save me the time of having to set everyone up at the time of the workshop, I have made this tutorial in order to help you get set up ahead of time.
So, we will be installing 3 things. You may choose to install all of them, or one of them, but please try to have one. Throughout the course I will be constantly switching syntaxes and languages, but they're all very similar, so you shouldn't have any problems.
## MIT-SCHEME
## COMMON LISP
## CLOJURE
